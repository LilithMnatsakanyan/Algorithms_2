### **📖 What I Learned**

These algorithms were developed and learned through my **university coursework**, alongside insights from **YouTube** tutorials and the book **_Grokking Algorithms, Second Edition_**. They provide efficient ways to solve classic problems like searching, string matching, and geometric problems, and I implemented them to gain a deeper understanding of computational complexity and optimization.

### **🛠️ How to Use the Repository**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LilithMnatsakanyan/Algorithms_2.git
   cd Algorithms_2
   ```

2. **Run the script** for the algorithm you'd like to test (e.g., `binary_search.py` or `exponential_search.py`):
   ```bash
   python binary_search.py
   ```

Each algorithm is written in **Python**, and you can modify inputs to explore different test cases or analyze performance across different datasets.
